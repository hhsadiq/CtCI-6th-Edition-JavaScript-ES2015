 * You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N
 * meters long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should have
 * different heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified
 * by a zero-indexed array H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the
 * wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0]
 * is the height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's
 * right end.
 * The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such
 * blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number of
 * blocks needed to build the wall.
 Write a function:
 function solution(H);
 that, given a zero-indexed array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.
 For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
 H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
 H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
 H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
 the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of seven blocks.
 Assume that:
 N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
 Complexity:
 expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
 Elements of input arrays can be modified.
 * @param H
 * @returns {*}
